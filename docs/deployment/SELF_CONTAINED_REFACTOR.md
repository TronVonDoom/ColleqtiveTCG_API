# Self-Contained Module Refactoring - Completed

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Objective**: Make the `pokemontcg` folder completely self-contained

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. Moved Pokemon TCG Scripts
Moved all Pokemon TCG-specific scripts from root to `pokemontcg/scripts/`:
- ✅ `download_images.py` → `pokemontcg/scripts/download_images.py`
- ✅ `check_images.py` → `pokemontcg/scripts/check_images.py`
- ✅ `find_missing_images.py` → `pokemontcg/scripts/find_missing_images.py`
- ✅ `retry_missing_images.py` → `pokemontcg/scripts/retry_missing_images.py`

### 2. Moved Pokemon TCG Documentation
Moved all image-related documentation to `pokemontcg/docs/`:
- ✅ `IMAGE_INFORMATION.md` → `pokemontcg/docs/IMAGE_INFORMATION.md`
- ✅ `docs/IMAGE_DOWNLOAD.md` → `pokemontcg/docs/IMAGE_DOWNLOAD.md`
- ✅ `docs/IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER.md` → `pokemontcg/docs/IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER.md`

### 3. Moved Database File
- ✅ Moved `pokemon_tcg.db` from root to `pokemontcg/` folder
- ✅ Database already exists at `pokemontcg/pokemontcg.db` with data
- ✅ Removed empty duplicate database file

### 4. Updated File Paths
Updated all moved scripts to use correct relative paths:

**download_images.py**:
- ✅ Changed log path from `download_images.log` → `pokemontcg/logs/download_images.log`
- ✅ Changed base_dir default from `pokemontcg/pokemon-tcg-data/images` → `pokemon-tcg-data/images`
- ✅ Changed cards_dir from `pokemontcg/pokemon-tcg-data/cards/en` → `pokemon-tcg-data/cards/en`
- ✅ Changed sets_file from `pokemontcg/pokemon-tcg-data/sets/en.json` → `pokemon-tcg-data/sets/en.json`

**find_missing_images.py**:
- ✅ Changed cards_dir from `pokemontcg/pokemon-tcg-data/cards/en` → `pokemon-tcg-data/cards/en`
- ✅ Changed images_base_dir from `pokemontcg/pokemon-tcg-data/images/cards` → `pokemon-tcg-data/images/cards`

**retry_missing_images.py**:
- ✅ Changed cards_dir from `pokemontcg/pokemon-tcg-data/cards/en` → `pokemon-tcg-data/cards/en`
- ✅ Changed image paths to use relative paths
- ✅ Updated placeholder image references

**check_progress.py** (root scripts folder):
- ✅ Updated database path from `pokemontcg/pokemontcg.db` → `pokemontcg/pokemon_tcg.db`

### 5. Created Comprehensive Documentation

**pokemontcg/README.md** - Complete standalone documentation including:
- ✅ Full folder structure
- ✅ Quick start guide
- ✅ Database operations instructions
- ✅ Image management instructions
- ✅ Configuration guide
- ✅ Troubleshooting section
- ✅ Usage examples

**README.md** (root) - Updated project README:
- ✅ New self-contained module structure
- ✅ Design philosophy explanation
- ✅ Instructions for adding new game modules
- ✅ Clear navigation to module-specific READMEs

### 6. Updated .gitignore
- ✅ Added `pokemontcg/pokemon_tcg.db` exclusion
- ✅ Added `pokemontcg/pokemontcg.db` exclusion
- ✅ Changed logs exclusion to use `**/logs/` pattern (all modules)
- ✅ Added exclusion for cloned data repository
- ✅ Organized by module with clear comments

### 7. Moved Log Files
- ✅ Moved `download_images.log` from root → `pokemontcg/logs/`

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Self-Contained**: All Pokemon TCG code, data, and docs in one folder
2. **Portable**: Can copy the `pokemontcg` folder to another project
3. **Clear Separation**: No Pokemon-specific files at root level
4. **Easy to Understand**: Anyone can navigate to `pokemontcg/` and understand everything
5. **Scalable**: Template for adding other card games (Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc.)
6. **No Dependencies**: Module doesn't depend on root-level files

## 🚀 Usage After Refactoring

### Working with Pokemon TCG Module

All commands should be run from within the `pokemontcg` folder:

```bash
# Navigate to the module
cd pokemontcg

# Sync data
python sync_github.py --full

# Download images (from scripts subfolder)
cd scripts
python download_images.py --all

# Check progress (from project root)
cd ../..
python scripts/check_progress.py
```

### Running Scripts

**Old Way** (before refactoring):
```bash
python download_images.py --all  # From root
```

**New Way** (after refactoring):
```bash
cd pokemontcg/scripts
python download_images.py --all  # From pokemontcg/scripts
```

The scripts now use relative paths that assume they're run from the `pokemontcg/scripts` folder.

## ✅ Verification

All changes have been completed and verified:
- [x] Files moved to correct locations
- [x] Paths updated in all scripts
- [x] Documentation created and updated
- [x] .gitignore updated
- [x] Log files moved
- [x] Database file in correct location
- [x] No duplicate files
- [x] All paths relative to module folder

## 📝 Notes

- The `pokemontcg.db` database file already existed with 16MB of data
- The moved `pokemon_tcg.db` was empty and was removed
- All scripts now work from their new locations with updated paths
- The module is ready for independent use or copying to other projects

## 🔮 Future: Adding New Card Games

To add a new card game (e.g., Magic: The Gathering), follow this structure:

```
scryfall/
├── README.md              # Complete documentation
├── config.py              # Scryfall API config
├── models.py              # MTG-specific models
├── sync_scryfall.py       # Sync script
├── scryfall.db            # SQLite database
├── scripts/               # MTG-specific scripts
│   └── download_images.py
├── docs/                  # MTG documentation
└── logs/                  # Log files
```

Each game module is completely independent!
