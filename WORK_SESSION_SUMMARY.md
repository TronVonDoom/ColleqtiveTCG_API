- **Status**: Process was killed (likely memory/time limit)
- **Completed Sets**: base1 through sm115 (Hidden Fates)
- **Remaining**: 29 sets (sm12 through swsh12pt5)
- **Location**: `~/public_html/pokemon-tcg-data/cards/en/`

### What Was Being Downloaded
The server was running a batch download of Pokemon TCG card images:
- Small images (~100KB each)
- Organized by set ID
- Total expected: ~17,000+ cards
- Estimated remaining: ~4,000 cards

## üìã Next Steps (For Home Computer)

### 1. Resume Image Download
The download was interrupted on the Hostinger server. You have several options:

**Option A: Resume via SSH** (Recommended)
```bash
# SSH to server
ssh u943200863@185.201.10.206

# Check current progress
cd ~/public_html/pokemon-tcg-data/cards/en/
ls -1 | wc -l  # Count sets downloaded

# Resume download in smaller batches (safer)
# Create script to download sets 86-114 in batches of 10
```

**Option B: Download Locally Then Upload**
```powershell
# On home computer
cd C:\Users\[YOUR_HOME_USER]\Documents\Github\ColleqtiveTCG\ColleqtiveTCG
.\download-images-final.py  # Downloads remaining sets
# Then upload via SCP when complete
```

**Option C: Use Railway API Directly**
The images can be accessed via your Railway API at:
`https://colletive-tcg-api-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/cards`

### 2. Verify Frontend Build
```powershell
cd C:\Users\[YOUR_HOME_USER]\Documents\Github\ColleqtiveTCG\ColleqtiveTCG
npm install  # First time on home computer
npm run build
.\verify-build.ps1
```

### 3. Test Deployment
```powershell
# Preview locally
npm run preview

# Deploy to Hostinger
.\deploy-to-hostinger.ps1
```
