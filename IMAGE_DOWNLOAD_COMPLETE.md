## 🚀 Frontend Integration

Your frontend is configured to use local images with automatic fallback:

```javascript
// imageConfig.js
ImageConfig = {
    localImageBase: 'https://colleqtivetcg.com/tcg-images',
    useLocalImages: true,
    enableFallback: true
}
```

### Load Priority:
1. **Primary**: Local Hostinger server (instant)
2. **Fallback**: Railway API proxy (if local fails)
3. **Final**: Placeholder or error state

## 📈 Performance Benefits

- ⚡ **Faster load times** - No external API calls
- 💾 **Reduced bandwidth** - Images served locally
